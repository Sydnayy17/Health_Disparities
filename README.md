# Health Disparities in Taiwan: Trends in the Incidence of STIs and Implications for SDG 3
1. Introduction
1.1 Background
   The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3) focuses on promoting
wellbeing and ensuring healthy lives for people of all ages. Despite Taiwan's advanced
healthcare system, disparities persist in healthcare access and outcomes, particularly
regarding the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and the equitable
distribution of healthcare resources. With the use of national-level data for 1952â€“2022 and
county-level data for 2023, this study aims to analyze and identify patterns in health
disparities related with STIs and healthcare access in Taiwan from 1952 to 2023.
